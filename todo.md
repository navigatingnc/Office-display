- [x] Research suitable technologies for local weather API integration
- [x] Outline the overall architecture (frontend, backend, APIs)

## Phase 2: Set up backend Flask application with API endpoints
- [x] Create Flask application using manus-create-flask-app utility
- [x] Set up basic Flask structure with CORS enabled
- [x] Create API endpoint for calendar events
- [x] Create API endpoint for weather data
- [x] Test basic Flask application
## Phase 3: Create frontend React application with responsive design
